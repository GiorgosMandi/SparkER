# SparkER

[JedAI](https://github.com/scify/JedAIToolkit) constitutes an open source, high scalability toolkit that offers out-of-the-box solutions for any data integration task, 
e.g., Record Linkage, Entity Resolution and Link Discovery. At its core lies a set of domain-independent, state-of-the-art techniques 
that apply to both RDF and relational data. These techniques rely on an approximate, schema-agnostic functionality based on (meta-)blocking 
for high scalability.

SparkER was the initial attempt to parallelize JedAI on top of Apache Spark. 
Visit its finalized its version in the repository [JedAI-Spark](https://github.com/scify/JedAI-Spark).
